\heading{Startup Weekend}{6pt}

Students from the 2026 ESCALATE class participated in Startup Weekend (Oct. 21-23). Startup Weekend is organized by Techstars, Rose Innovative Student Entrepreneurs (RISE), Delta Rho Sigma, and ESCALATE. The event gave students an opportunity to experience what it's like take an idea and start transforming it into a business. Students were able to speak with mentors and receive feedback to help shape their ideas.
