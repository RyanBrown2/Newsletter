\customtitle{Who We Are}{6pt}

Delta Rho Sigma is a professional fraternity that focuses on entrepreneurship. We look to provide an environment that helps students integrate an entrepreneurial mindset into their personal talents and high-level engineering and business skills.

\heading{Startup Weekend}{6pt}

Students from the 2026 ESCALATE class participated in Startup Weekend (Oct. 21-23). Startup Weekend is organized by Techstars, Rose Innovative Student Entrepreneurs (RISE), Delta Rho Sigma, and ESCALATE. The event allowed students to experience what it's like to take an idea and start transforming it into a business. Students were able to speak with mentors and receive feedback to help shape their ideas.
